After a good night‚Äôs sleep, I went ahead, forked xgbutil, made the necessary changes to it, then to my application, and now my app is finnaly the way I wanted it.\nThere are more features that could be added to my hotkey daemon, like multi-hotkey chords or mouse bindings, that I will probably implement some day, who knows‚Ä¶\n","wordCount":"460","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-12-29T23:59:12+02:00","dateModified":"2021-12-29T23:59:12+02:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alex11br.github.io/posts/gxhk/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Popa Ioan Alexandru","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alex11br.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://alex11br.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Popa Ioan Alexandru (Alt + H)"><img src=/logo.jpg alt=logo aria-label=logo height=32>Popa Ioan Alexandru</a>
