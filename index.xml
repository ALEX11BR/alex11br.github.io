When I first started using Github Pages, I used Jekyll as a static site generator. It had the advantage of being very easy to get up and running: just create a repo in which you put the markdown files you want to turn into web pages, with other eventual raw HTML you might have, commit, push, and voila, you have a working website.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re seeing this, this site is now running with Hugo.</p>
<p>When I first started using Github Pages, I used Jekyll as a static site generator. It had the advantage of being very easy to get up and running: just create a repo in which you put the markdown files you want to turn into web pages, with other eventual raw HTML you might have, commit, push, and voila, you have a working website.</p>
<p>That being said, while getting Jekyll to work on the Github Pages remote which publishes the site is super easy, getting it to work on my machines so that I can properly see whatever changes I make to the site isn&rsquo;t that easy. My experience with setting up Ruby on my machines has always been a really painful one, having to fight error after error, and as someone who doesn&rsquo;t use Ruby anywhere else, this is not what I want to go through to see my changes in my blogs. This experience just makes me want to stay away from using Ruby to make apps, I don&rsquo;t like it at all.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just too dumb to use Ruby and its apps, but I just don&rsquo;t like having to set it up. So I tried to look for other static site generators that don&rsquo;t make me install all sorts of <em>dubious runtimes and dependencies</em>, and I found 2 viable alternatives: Zola and Hugo - both written in statically compiled languages (the opposite of <em>dubious runtimes and dependencies</em> - that&rsquo;s pretty cool ðŸ˜Ž).</p>
<p>I ended up choosing Hugo, as I found <a href="https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod">this theme</a> that I could get configured just the way I wanted my blog to be - yay! While some people on the internet appreciated Zola&rsquo;s simplicity as opposed to Hugo, I just could not get my way around its simplicity&hellip;</p>
<p>I hope this post will not be the only one I post here, I hope to write more stuff here, but I haven&rsquo;t a good track record on this. Maybe this is an opportunity to start fresh, to have a better plan with this online space&hellip; We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
