I have various projects that I've made across the years of my existence. As I am a Romanian, some of the projects presented are in Romanian; they will get a Romanian flag(ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´).

- [Compunere de oscilaÈ›ii paralele](/fizoscomp) ([source](https://github.com/ALEX11BR/fizoscom)) ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´
- [Proportional election methods simulation](/proportional-election-simulation) ([source](https://github.com/ALEX11BR/proportional-election-simulation))
- [AltSFX](https://github.com/ALEX11BR/AltSFX) is an alternative sound effects pack for OpenTTD, and is available through the in-game online content system.
- [ThemeChanger](https://github.com/ALEX11BR/ThemeChanger) lets you change GUI themes on Linux with ease. ([blogpost](/posts/themechanger))
- As a linux user I have various [dotfiles](https://github.com/ALEX11BR/dotfiles)

I'm not only a programmer, but I also have other miscellaneous projects:

- I (used to) make photos of public transportation vehicles, available [here](https://alexioanpopa.blogspot.com/p/poze-vehicule-transport-in-comun.html). ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´
- I also make some maps, that can be seen [here](https://alexioanpopa.blogspot.com/search/label/H%C4%83r%C8%9Bi). ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´
