Hi there! I'm Popa Ioan Alexandru (aka ALEX11BR or other nicks), a 21-year-old guy from Romania who's trying to find meaning in life using computers.

I have various [projects](projects), mostly computer-related, but not only.
I also have a [resume](resume/resume.pdf).

# My latest posts
I _[try](https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/19/)_ here to maintain a blog, which even has a [RSS feed](index.xml).
